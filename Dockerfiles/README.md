# Dockerfiles

This directory contains the Dockerfiles needed to create the images that are used by the actions in this repository. The images are simply a copy of [cmssw/el8:x86_64](https://hub.docker.com/r/cmssw/el8), but pre-packaged with the data needed to run the tests. The images can be generated by first putting the `trackingNtuple_ttbar_PU200.root` and `step2_21034.1_100Events.root` files in this directory and then running the following commands.

```bash
docker build -t <username>/el8:standalone -f Dockerfile-standalone .
docker build -t <username>/el8:cmssw -f Dockerfile-cmssw .
```

where `<username>` should be replaced with the appropriate DockerHub username. Then they should be uploaded to DockerHub using the following commands.

```bash
docker push <username>/el8:standalone
docker push <username>/el8:cmssw
```
